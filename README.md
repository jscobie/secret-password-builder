# Challenge 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Build passwords through a website

## Description

This project was built to showcase my ability to supply a working JavaScript random password generator using my in/out of class work.

Once on the deployed site the user can press the Generate Password button, which will bring up a prompt for the user to enter a number 8 - 128, if a number outside the range is picked an error is shown - if the user picks anything other than a number that will also show an error. Then the code will send confirm windows to ask if the user wants to include the following in the generated password : Lowercase letters, Uppercase letters, Numbers, and/or Special Characters. Once the page receives the user inputs to all 5 it will then display a created password based on all inputs and show it on the box on the screen.

I'd like to point out the TA Vince Shury helped a coupl of us on a "How to start challenges" and that step really helped me learn a new way to work on my how to start process and really increased my ability to solve this quickly.
